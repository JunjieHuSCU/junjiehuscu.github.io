I am currently an Associate Professor in the College of Computer Science at Sichuan University. I received my Ph.D. from Sichuan University under the supervision of Professor Zhang Yi (章毅).

My research interests are centered on artificial intelligence and its applications in the medical field, with a particular focus on radiotherapy. Specific areas of expertise include medical image analysis and fully automated radiotherapy treatment planning. To date, I have published over 30 papers in international journals and conferences <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=T3NJS_kAAAAJ'><img src="images/google_scholar_icon.png" alt="Google Scholar" style="height:20px; vertical-align:middle;"></a>. If you are interested in my research, please don't hesitate to contact me via email at <a href="mailto:hujunjie@scu.edu.cn" >hujunjie@scu.edu.cn</a>.

You can find information about my publications, teaching, and more in the top navigation bar.
